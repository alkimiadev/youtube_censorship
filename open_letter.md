Subject: Escalation Request: Concerns Regarding "Good Faith" Moderation Practices

Dear YouTube,

I am writing to express my growing concerns regarding YouTube’s moderation practices and the apparent lack of "good faith" in addressing specific issues I have repeatedly raised. While I have consistently sought to engage in open and constructive discussions, I am becoming increasingly convinced that my concerns are being ignored or dismissed through generic responses and redirection to feedback forms. This approach is not only unhelpful but may also reflect a deeper issue of "bad faith" moderation.

To reiterate, YouTube, as a platform, has statutory obligations to perform moderation in good faith. I have cited these obligations in prior communications and have asked for acknowledgment of the issue, yet no meaningful response has been provided. I strongly recommend escalating this matter to your legal department for review and a direct response. Failure to address these concerns now may lead to significantly more challenging scenarios in the future, including reputational and legal risks.

### Terms of Service (TOS) Violations

YouTube’s Terms of Service explicitly define comments as “content” and outline specific steps for content removal, including notification and appeal processes. Despite this, when comments are moderated (removed or hidden), users are neither notified nor given a mechanism to appeal, directly violating YouTube’s stated policies. This inconsistency between YouTube’s TOS and its actual practices raises serious questions about YouTube’s adherence to its contractual obligations and statutory requirements.

### Lack of Transparency and Escalation Mechanisms

The absence of transparent escalation channels and meaningful responses to concerns raised by users undermines confidence in YouTube’s commitment to its community guidelines and policies. This systemic lack of accountability, combined with vague or generic responses, raises serious concerns about the integrity of YouTube’s moderation practices. Furthermore, this pattern of non-engagement highlights a critical gap in YouTube’s support and escalation mechanisms.

### Potential Legal and Reputational Risks

Ignoring such concerns not only exposes YouTube to reputational damage but also increases the risk of legal challenges. Statutory obligations to perform moderation in "good faith" are not merely ethical imperatives; they have legal and financial implications, particularly in jurisdictions such as the Ninth Circuit. I strongly urge YouTube to prioritize addressing these concerns before they escalate into more severe reputational and legal consequences.

### Proposed Actions and Implications

Here are the key steps I am considering should this pattern of non-engagement persist:

1. **Establishing a Non-Profit Entity in the Ninth Circuit**:
   This entity will conduct data gathering and analysis in compliance with legal precedent, such as *hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp*, ensuring that this research is both lawful and respectful of YouTube’s operations.

2. **Empirical Analysis of Moderation Practices**:
   I will objectively analyze the baseline moderation practices, including the "sort by newest" feature. If the results indicate systemic bias or arbitrary actions that disproportionately hide comments, this will contribute to evidence of "bad faith" moderation.

3. **Addressing DMCA Takedowns and Moderation Issues**:
   I will work with individuals who have experienced predatory DMCA takedowns or questionable moderation decisions. These issues appear to follow similar patterns of inconsistent application, which can further substantiate concerns about bad faith.

4. **Collaboration with Legal Experts and Data Scientists**:
   I will collaborate with professionals to establish an empirical baseline for evaluating "bad faith" and explore potential legal actions, including class actions, on behalf of affected users.

5. **Development of a Modern Automated Good Faith Moderation Framework**:
   I am independently designing a framework to demonstrate how modern automated systems can uphold "good faith" principles in moderation. This work will also highlight examples from YouTube’s practices as case studies of "bad faith" moderation.

6. **Legal Discovery**:
   If these efforts escalate to litigation, I anticipate that internal communications and decision-making processes regarding moderation will become part of the discovery process. Transparency in this context could prove critical.

### Closing Statement

It is important to note that failure to respond in a timely and meaningful manner will be interpreted as an overt demonstration of bad faith. I have repeatedly sought clarification and resolution regarding these concerns, only to be met with either silence or generic responses that fail to address the substantive issue at hand. This pattern of non-engagement not only undermines trust but also reinforces the perception that YouTube is not committed to its stated policies of fairness and transparency.

I urge you to seize this opportunity to resolve the matter constructively. A failure to act now will compel me to escalate this issue further, including pursuing the steps outlined above.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your response.
