### Shadow Banning Case Study in YouTube’s Community Forums

This document outlines my experience with shadow banning in YouTube’s community forums. I have posted three replies in a specific thread, yet only my main account can see these replies. Despite this, there has been no notification of moderation, and there is no apparent way to appeal these hidden posts. Below, I present the relevant links, evidence, and discussion to highlight the systemic issue of bad faith moderation.

### Analysis and Discussion

**1. Evidence of Shadow Banning**  
The evidence clearly demonstrates that my follow-up posts are visible only from my main account. Both my secondary account and private browsing tests show that these posts are hidden despite the interface indicating "3 replies."

**2. Lack of Notification and Appeal**  
At no point did I receive a notification that these posts were moderated or hidden. Additionally, there is no clear method to appeal or even confirm the moderation decision, leaving me with no recourse.

**3. Comparison to "Gold Product Expert" Behavior**  
In Hidden Post 1, I included screenshots of a \"Gold Product Expert\" exhibiting arguably toxic behavior in the forums. His replies are dismissive, insulting, and far more confrontational than my follow-up posts, yet they remain visible. This suggests selective or biased enforcement of moderation policies. Notably, this expert threatens another user by claiming to have flagged their account, but it is unclear who was being addressed as there were multiple participants in the thread. Given that my posts are hidden, it raises concerns that I may have been the target of this action. I disengaged from the conversation after receiving a flood of dismissive and insulting comments, which were sent to my email. Hidden Post 1 is particularly valuable as it provides a comparison for hidden comments on YouTube and highlights the lack of meaningful support for resolving these issues.

**4. Implications for Transparency and Trust**  
These practices undermine trust in YouTube’s support systems. Shadow banning without transparency erodes confidence in the platform and raises serious questions about moderation integrity.
