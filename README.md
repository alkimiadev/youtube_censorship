## Overview

This repository is dedicated to documenting and analyzing systemic issues in YouTube’s moderation practices. The aim is to gather evidence, highlight discrepancies between YouTube’s stated policies and actual practices, and advocate for more transparent and fair moderation systems.

## Contents

### 1. **open\_letter.md**

An open letter addressed to YouTube, outlining concerns regarding "bad faith" moderation practices. The letter highlights specific violations of YouTube’s Terms of Service, lack of transparency, and the absence of an appeal process for moderated content.

### 2. **log/**

A directory containing detailed logs and case studies of moderation incidents:

- **community\_forum.md**\
  A detailed case study documenting shadow banning in YouTube’s community forums. This includes evidence of hidden posts, screenshots, and an analysis of a "Gold Product Expert's" behavior.

- **youtube.md** *(upcoming)*\
  A log of incidents where YouTube comments were hidden, including screenshots and descriptions. This will serve as further evidence of moderation inconsistencies.

- **Craig.md**\
  A compilation of insulting and dismissive comments from a "Gold Product Expert" in the community forums. This document supports the claim of biased and unprofessional behavior among forum moderators.

### 3. **screenshots/**

Contains all the relevant screenshots used as evidence in the logs and open letter. These include:

- Views from different accounts showing hidden posts.
- Examples of toxic comments from forum moderators.
- Screenshots of hidden YouTube comments.

## Objectives

1. **Documentation**: Log every instance of hidden posts or comments, with accompanying evidence.
2. **Analysis**: Compare YouTube’s moderation actions to its Terms of Service and Community Guidelines to identify discrepancies.
3. **Advocacy**: Use the findings to advocate for more transparent and fair moderation systems, both through direct communication with YouTube and by raising awareness publicly.

## Future Plans

- Complete the **youtube.md** log with detailed documentation of hidden comments on YouTube.
- Conduct a toxicity analysis of both hidden and visible comments using Detoxify to compare moderation decisions.
- Provide instructions for users to download their own comments from YouTube via Google Takeout.
- Develop and share Colab notebooks to help users analyze their comments using Detoxify.
- Collaborate with other users facing similar issues to strengthen the case for systemic change.
